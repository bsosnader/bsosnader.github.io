        <title>Maze Runner</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/maze.png&quot; alt=&quot;maze runner&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maze Runner&lt;/em&gt;, by James Dashner, is one of those ~classic~ young adult, dystopian science fiction novels that have been all the rage for the past decade. You may have heard about the movie that was made from it. The movie was trash. But the book wasn’t bad. I really enjoyed it, and even reread it a few times. I think that even if a writer follows a stereotypical genre, or doesn’t use much complexity in their writing, a book can still be just fun to read. This book was fun to read because of the concept behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book, children are stuck in a massive underground labrynth. There’s a lot of mystery behind the whole purpose behind any of it. They have to try to figure out a way out, while avoiding the Maze’s many dangers. The mystery of the Maze, and the motivations behind it, make up a large part of the book. It’s a really interesting concept. Much like everyone liked The Hunger Games because of its unique concept, the same applies here. I wouldn’t go into this book expecting much, but it’s a fun and quick read if you’re looking for a dystopian future sci fi fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to warn you though, do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; try reading any of the other sequels to this book. You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;, if you really want to, but they just got extremely weird and really bad. Some crazy stuff goes down, and I just was not enjoying it. James Dashner is a good writer, but I think he overtaxed himself here. Still, though, the first book is good, and also is another book which is better than its movie. I don’t think I’ve seen any movies that were better than their books. If you have I’d love to hear about them. That’s all for this week!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Obamacare and Partisanship</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The Affordable Care Act, or as it’s better known, Obamacare, has been a sharply partisan issue since the moment it was conceived. One would think that on the topic of healthcare, both sides of the aisle could come together to find a solution good for the entirety of America, however, that has not been the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The history of Obamacare begins on the campaign trail. Obama promises a solution to rising healthcare costs, saying, “On health care reform, the American people are too often offered two extremes — government-run health care with higher taxes or letting the insurance companies operate without rules. … I believe both of these extremes are wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama, from the very start of his first term, was committed to making some form of healthcare reform happen. He began discussions, pushed Congress to start drafting up plans, and made it one of his priorities. It’s important to note that Obama took a different approach than Bill Clinton had before him. Bill Clinton had formed a plan of his own, and then presented it to Congress. Obama knew that he had to let Congress work out something that could actually get passed. Obama also made sure he had the support of some major players in the healthcare industry, something else that was needed. Most importantly, Obama tried, from the very beginning, to get Republican support for the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that goal simply was not happening. In 2009, the healthcare bill passed through the House (where Democrats had a supermajority) with only a singular Republican vote. It would find a much more difficult time getting through the Senate. In the Senate, the so-called “Gang of Six” formed, contrived of three Democrats and three Republicans, who were supposed to build a bill that would be agreeable for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the basis of the plan discussed at this point was actually a Republican healthcare plan from the 90s. It was not a single-payer system, which would be a firmly Democratic and liberal system. It still involved the insurance companies and it still had an individual mandate. However, it was certainly a step in the right direction. Obama was trying to make real compromise here, along with the Democratic Congresspeople.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the negotiations were a sham. Mitch McConnell, leader of the Senate Republicans, had already told his members that they could not reach a deal with the Democrats, and that none of them would be voting for any sort of healthcare reform bill. (Sidenote: I can’t be unbiased here. Mitch McConnell is a partisan hack. He represents everything that is wrong with the Republican party, and partisan politics as a whole. His obstructionism of the past eight years, and his, frankly, imbecilic manner of running the Senate, is pathetic. I can’t stand anything about the man.) The negotiations went on for a little while more, and then fell apart. Eventually, when brought to a vote, every single Democrat voted for, while every Republican voted against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest is history. Obamacare went to the Supreme Court, and was upheld. Due to the controversy, Republicans were able to make sweeping gains in the House in 2010, which, coupled with the census, lead to the redistricting and gerrymandering I talked about last article. Republicans would spend the next eight years blocking anything and everything that even had a faint whiff of Obama on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/aca.png&quot; alt=&quot;affordable care act&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what partisanship does to America. An originally Republican plan gets decried by Republicans simply because Democrats were the ones pushing for it. Healthcare reform, something everyone needed at the time, was crippled by the partisanship of Congress. People hated Obamacare simply because of the name Obama. I remember watching a video clip of people being asked if they preferred the Affordable Care Act over Obamacare. Many said yes, having no idea they were the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even now, partisanship blinds citizens from making rational decisions about the policies their government passes. There are thousands of Republican Trump supporters who are on Obamacare, who don’t want it to go away. If you look on Twitter, you can see them complaining to Trump about repealing it. They didn’t realize what they voted for, and now they regret it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be funny, if it weren’t so sad.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bad Feminist</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/fem.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;bad feminist cover&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, since you all hate Dave Eggers so much, I figured I’d review a book that I’m currently reading and enjoying that I actually think you’d all like. It’s called &lt;em&gt;Bad Feminist&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s by Roxane Gay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is basically a collection of essays written by Roxane, often about her own life experiences, which she uses to make broader points and discussions about society today. The meaning of the title of the book is something she explores in some of her essays, namely, that it is okay to not always be a “perfect feminist.” She says that it should be okay for one to enjoy today’s often degrading music, or shows like The Bachelor, while also fighting for women’s rights. Tha’ts not really what she focuses on too much though, as the book is mostly a discussion of the feminist movement and female issues in society as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really, really good. It’s probably one of the most level-headed, even handed approaches to the subject. I mean, I’m probably a little biased, but I really do think it gives a good, in-depth look at issues women face without going into “all men are pigs” territory. There are a few times where she goes off on tangents that aren’t really relavent (there’s a whole chapter about Scrabble) and some of the books she references and talks about are kind of terrible, but whenever she starts to get into the meat of an issue you can tell she’s passionate about, the fire of her emotions and words comes out on the page.  I’ve included a quote from her essay on privilege. The whole essay is really good, but this part is the best:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You don’t necessarily have to do anything once you acknowledge your privilege. You don’t have to apologize for it. You need to understand the extent of your privilege, the consequences of your privilege, and remain aware that people who are different from you move through and experience the world in ways you might never know anything about. They might endure situations you can never know anything about. You could, however, use that privilege for the greater good—to try to level the playing field for everyone, to work for social justice, to bring attention to how those without certain privileges are disenfranchised. We’ve seen what the hoarding of privilege has done, and the results are shameful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t finished reading the book yet, but I’m interested to see what else Gay has to say. Her perspective is very relevant and important.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>You Shall Know Our Velocity!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/velocity.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;velocity cover&quot; /&gt;
Before we continue, I need to warn you–this is a Dave Eggers book. If you’re not a fan of Dave Eggers, don’t even bother considering reading this book. You probably won’t like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t really know what it is that I like so much about Eggers’ writing (other than &lt;em&gt;The Circle&lt;/em&gt;, which I &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; like), but, much like &lt;em&gt;A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,&lt;/em&gt;  this book also taps into something deeply emotional inside me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book follows the path of two friends who have decided to travel the world in one week. One of them has apparently came into a large sum of money, and wants to get rid of it as quickly as possible. Their plan is to hand out random wads of cash to people they think deserve it in every location they’re in. It actually raises a lot of questions about charity in general. Is it right to give away money only to those you feel &lt;em&gt;deserve&lt;/em&gt; it? To expect people to behave a certain way just in the hopes that you’ll deem them worthy of your money? On the surface, it seems obvious that they’re doing a good thing for people. But the way some of the recipients react to the money makes you question it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also an interesting plot device that makes its way halfway into the book. Eggers actually revised the book, adding 49 extra pages that actually pretty heavily influence what’s going on. It’s really unique, and another part of the reason why I like Eggers so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the book is about traveling, I recommend reading it (if you ever bother) during some sort of travel. It really enhances the feelings and emotions you get while reading it. Anyway, from now on I’ll try to avoid any more Dave Eggers and stick to books that people might actually enjoy reading.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gerrymandering</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Gerrymandering. It’s a political term heard in the media often, flung at both Democrats and Republicans alike. Typically connotated as negative, it’s been picking up steam as the rhetoric against “corrupt politicians” has become increasingly more popular. However, before immediately deciding on its efficacy one way or another, it’s important to understand what it is, and where it came from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The definition of gerrymandering is “to manipulate the boundaries of (an electoral constituency) so as to favor one party or class.” Voting districts for state or federal congressional districts can be shaped in ways to include or exclude certain areas of the population. For instance, if a politician knows that one area of town supports him, but another does not, he would prefer it if his district only included the people who do support him, to better his chances of winning. This type of shaping can silence the voices of people who would vote against the party in charge of the districting by splitting them up and diluting their voting power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/gerrymander.png&quot; alt=&quot;gerrymandering&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The origin of the funny little word itself is a portmanteau of “salamander” and “Gerry.” The Gerry comes from the last name of a certain Elbridge Gerry, who, in 1812, did just what the definition says–reshaped his district to favor his party. The shape was said to look somewhat like a salamander, and the name stuck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what has the history of gerrymandering looked like, and how does it affect the political parties of today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 19th and early 20th century, the majority of gerrymandered districts were due to racism. The aim of many district-drawers in deep southern states was to weaken the voting powers of African Americans as much as possible. Because African Americans typically tended to vote Democrat, not Republican, the districts in these mostly Republican states were drawn to prevent the minorities from having a say in their governance. That’s not to say Democrats didn’t do it as well. Gerrymandering has a long history with both political parties spanning back many decades. It’s a tool that’s been used by corrupt politicans on both sides of the aisle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/gerry2.png&quot; alt=&quot;gerrymandering&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after the Voting Rights Act of 1965, things started to change. Laws were drawn preventing disctrics from being drawn in a way to disenfranchise minority voters, and a few of the worst offending states were required to submit any new districts to the Department of Justice for review. Furthermore, some new districts were actually purposefully gerrymandered to create so-called “majority-minority” districts, where a district was drawn specifically to give a voice to a minority community in an area. This demonstrates how gerrymandering is not always for a nefarious purpose. If there is a town that has 70% of one community and 30% of another, and you have to split it into two districts, there are a few options you have. You could split it right down the middle, giving each district 35% of the majority and 15% of the minority. However, now the majority will have the loudest voice in both districts, completely shutting off the minority. If you instead draw a larger district encompassing just the 70%, and a smaller one just encompassing the 30%, you get one district which represents the majority, and one which represents the minority. It’s still technically “unfair,” but it allows minorities to not get shut out of representation–especially in the light of the decades of racism and discrimination preceding (and following) the Voting Rights Act.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, even these sorts of districts can cause problems. In recent years, many “safe” red states have gained increasing amounts of minority populations. When populations increase, districts must be redrawn to accomodate them. One might assume that the best way to do it fairly would be using the “majority-minority” districting from above. However, that can be disenfranchising as well. If you have three typically red districts, each which have gained a large amount of a minority, you might be at risk of losing all of them, if enough minorty support swings them. If you instead funnel all those minorities into one &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; district, you can give them one district, but keep your original three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/gerry5.png&quot; alt=&quot;gerry 5&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what’s gerrymandering like today? In 2010, a wave of hardcore Republican “Tea Party” politicians were voted into office. The timing, along with the 2010 census, meant these people were in charge of drawing new districts. Unsurprisingly, they gerrymandered the hell out of them. For the past 7 years now, Republicans in the House of Representatives have enjoyed a majority in part due to their control of state legislature and governances which lead to favorable districts for the House. The Republican party, in the past several years, has been more effective at gaining support in state and local politics, which allows them to have the groudwork to get more Congressmen elected, using, among other things, gerrymandering. Is it unfair? Yes. Is it legal? Also yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current, one-sided use of gerrymandering by the Republican party is indicative of the growing divide between the two parties in Congress. It’s also indicative of the Democrats failure to mobilize grassroots as effectively as the Republicans. The Democrats must change their tactics if they want to overcome the effect decimination of their support that the Republicans have set in motion. It’s actually quite shocking to realize that even with the massive shifts in demographics that have occured in the past decades, mostly in favor of groups that vote Democrat, the majority of states are Republican-controlled, Republicans have a majority in the Senate and the House, and a Republican is in the Oval Office. It’s a combination of Republican voter-supression tactics, gerrymandering, but also a Democratic failure to capitalize on the shifting political landscape. One thing is certain, however–gerrymandering breaks the democratic process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there solutions? Once again, yes, but it will take a long time before we see change. Gerrymandering is used by both parties go keep their power, and those who got elected due to gerrymandering are hardly going to turn around and destroy the very thing that gave them their power. But what can be done? Some states use nonpartisan committees to draw boundaries instead of the politicans, but even these committees can be infiltrated with partisanship. There are also computer algorithms which can draw perfectly “fair” districts, which seem quite promising, when looking at the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/gerry3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;gerrymandering 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results are quite different than the original, snaking, convoluted districts. Problem solved, right? Not exactly. These kinds of districts forego some of the positive possibilities of gerrymandering–allowing minorities to get representation where they otherwise would not. It’s likely that the best solution will involve a combination of computer algorithms and committees. For now, we’ll just have to deal with this being considered “fair representation:”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/gerry4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;gerrymandering 4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Topics for Civic Issues and Passion Blogs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My passion blog will be the same: books! There’s so many more books (obviously). I may also do some negative reviews. For the Civic Issues blog, I’ve decided I want to talk about party politics and some things that have changed and occurred to affect that over the years. It should be interesting, and I have a lot I could talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>This I Believe First Draft</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, I liked to argue. A LOT. I debated endlessly with my parents, fiercely combating against what I saw to be completely arbitrary rules, regulations, and restrictions. I remember one time, when I wanted to stay up late on a school night. My dad countered my request, saying, “But you’ll be exhausted tomorrow morning!” I shook my head, and he acquiesced. I was triumphant! Yet, just as he had said, the next morning was hell. When gently asked if I was tired, I stoically refused to admit it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I grew up, my stubbornness softened. I still kept my love of debate, but I no longer stuck to my guns as firmly as I had as a child. The turning point came one day, in high school English class, when I was arguing with my friend about some topic we had learned in class. He made a particularly good point, and I suddenly realized he was right. I agreed with him. I knew I had lost, yet, it was freeing to be able to change my mind, accept a new answer, and move on. I believe in this sort of discourse. Often, people simply repeat their own rhetoric, never actually looking at the facts or making an informed decision. This attitude emphasizes a “right versus wrong” mentality, instead of one of collaboration and learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe in being able to accept a new viewpoint, because without that skill, I would never have been able to learn as much as I have, both inside and outside of a classroom. Being able to rationally and coherently debate differing views, and being willing to accept when one is wrong, is essential for progress. Too often people are caught up in how they feel and what they believe, instead of listening to the facts in front of them. I believe it is necessary to be able to step back, look at the big picture, and reforge one’s ideas and beliefs in the face of new information. Without that ability, we will be lost to increasing divisions and disagreements. Let’s not agree to disagree, let’s agree to debate.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ideas for Passion Blog and Civic Issues Blog</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;For my passion blog, I’m planning on doing the same topic as before–books! I’ve still got a lot to share. For my civic issues blog, I’m thinking a good topic might be looking at new legislation that is proposed/passed under the new presidency, and what kind of impacts and effects it may have, and how it differs from previous legislation. Another topic could be about party politics and how it has changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the “This I Believe” project, I have two ideas. The first is bascially, “I believe in doing things I enjoy.” Often we are pushed to do things because they will help us get a job, or look good on a resume, and so on. Yet, for me, that’s not worth it. I do things because of what they mean to me. Another one would basically be “I believe in discourse.” I firmly and strongy believe that everyone should be open to discussion and argument and be able to accept when they are wrong and accept new viewpoints. Being able to calmly discuss issues and bring up factual, well reasoned arguments are extremely important to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s it!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Making a Webapp with AngularJS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It hadn’t yet been a day since I’d been home for winter break, and I already had grown bored of just sitting around. Sure, we all dream of the promised land after the semester is over, where there are no responsibilities and no homework, and where finals are nothing but a faint memory in our heads, but in reality, it gets old, fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of finals, though, there’s a peculiar phenonenom the seems to occur during the last week or so of the semester—college students, instead of studying, will inevitably spend all of their free time calculating the lowest possible grade they can get on their finals to still get the grade they want in their classes. I’m not immune to it myself—it’s fun, and quite frankly relieving, to discover you only need a 65% on your CS final to get an A in the course. And if you look online, you’ll find there’s plenty of websites that do the calculations for you. I decided to make one too.
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to cure my boredom and learn at the same time, so I decided to make it using something I haven’t really had experience with before: &lt;a href=&quot;https://angular.io&quot;&gt;AngularJS&lt;/a&gt;. Although this idea has been done plenty of times before, I thought it would be a nice way to experiment with AngularJS. You can find the finished project &lt;a href=&quot;http://sosnader.tk/grade-calc&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I faced a few challenges in getting this project up and running, but all in all it only took me the better part of a Sunday afternoon. The biggest challenge that I had to overcome was to actually figure out how AngularJS worked. I had really never touched any sort of Javascript framework before this point and I didn’t really understand the concept. After going through some tutorials and example code on the AngularJS website, I felt ready enough to tackle the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Angular team makes it really easy to get a project up and running with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cli.angular.io/&quot;&gt;angular-cli&lt;/a&gt; tool. After running their setup, all I had to do was configure a few components, set up my form and calculations, and apply some styles. It’s pretty barebones, but it got me to learn the basics of what AngularJS is all about, and I’m excited to be be able to use its tools in future projects.&lt;/p&gt;
