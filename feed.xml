        <title>Perks of Being a Wallflower</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/wallflower.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&amp;quot;cover&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you guys have heard of &lt;em&gt;Perks of Being a Wallflower&lt;/em&gt;, either from the popular movie or from the book it was based off of. I remember seeing trailers for the movie but never really looking into it, thinking it wasn’t my kind of movie. I had no idea it was originally a book until a friend of mine insisted that I read it. Apparently I was “four years too late” (the book’s about a freshman in high school) but I figured I could still enjoy it. He told me “if you can, read it in one sitting.” So I did. I read it over the weekend, without any expectations or understanding of what it was about going in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not what I was expecting at all, but it was amazing. If you don’t know, the story follows a boy, Charlie, as he enters high school and completes his freshman year. Charlie is not okay. He has faced many unfortunate circumstances, is a bit socially awkward, and can’t really seem to figure out his place in the world. Charlie’s freshman year is full of twists and turns, and ups and downs, and through it all, we always see Charlie being as genuine and kind as always. He’s incredibly selfless, but has trouble taking care of himself. The book is intense, touching on very rough topics. It’s very interesting to see the way these topics are viewed through the lense of a teenage boy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s so much packed into the book for its length, and to be honest, it made me tear up multiple times. There are some passages that sort of bite right into your core, unveiling things you maybe didn’t really want to think about before. If you get the chance, read it, and read it in one sitting. It’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Paradigm Shift</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The paradigm shift that I think I would most likely choose for this assignment actually comes from another class I’m taking– Astro 5. In astronomy, there was a drastic paradigm shift around the time of Galileo and Keplar from a geocentric model of the universe to a heliocentric model. Basically, the world changed from believing that the universe rotated around the Earth to believing that the Earth rotated around the Sun. This change actually had drastic effects not only for the scientific community but also philosophically and religiously. There was tons of controversy about this change and it affected many things in many different sciences and teachings. I think it would be a really interesting topic to delve deep into, because today, we all know how the Solar System works, but back then, the “heavens” were thought of far differently than we think of them now. So I’m not really gonna put up another choice unless you guys really think this is a bad one, because I’m pretty set on this idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite TED talk is one by Glenn Greenwald entitled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters&quot;&gt;Why Privacy Matters&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a discussion of why, in this digital age, our privacy still should matter to us. I actually used quotes from it when I was writing my Schreyer admission essay on the topic, and I think it’s especially pertinent to us given our reading of &lt;em&gt;The Circle.&lt;/em&gt; It’s definitely interesting to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Giver</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/giver.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;the giver cover&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Giver&lt;/em&gt;, by Lois Lowry is a book that many of us probably had to read for school at some point in our lives. I actually didn’t, and only recently read it. It’s more of a book for people a little bit younger than me, but I still found it enjoyable, and the ideas it explored made me think. We actually discussed it (well, the movie) in our AP Psychology class that year, and after I read The Circle, and especially after I responded to this week’s prompt about &lt;em&gt;The Circle&lt;/em&gt;, I thought of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book takes place in a futuristic society where all pain, fear, war, and hatred is eliminated. Everyone and everything is bascially the same. The people are uniform and conform to what the leaders ask for. The plot revolves around a boy, Jonas, who is chosen to be the society’s next “giver.” The concept of the giver is very intriguing, and what Jonas struggles with is the main theme of the story. Like I have with all the previous books, I won’t give much away, but if you haven’t already read it, it’s worth the read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’d really like to talk about the society that’s set up in &lt;em&gt;The Giver.&lt;/em&gt; The conformity of the people clearly leads to less pain and hate, but is it worth it? That question is emphasized in the book, and I think it’s important to consider. In &lt;em&gt;The Circle&lt;/em&gt;, too, the goal is to eliminate things like crime, corruption, and hatred by exposing everyone to everything and controlling it all. Is it worth the loss of rights, the lost of individuality, and the loss of freedom? Eggers clearly thinks not, but what do you think? Really consider it. I mean, a world without crime is unimaginable. A goal that would be amazing to reach. But what are we willing to give up to get it?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>*The Circle* and Transparency</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ll be responding to prompt 2, and discussing The Circle’s three mantras: “Secrets are Lies,” “Sharing is Caring, “ and “Privacy is Theft.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although these mantras may seem very tempting (and I’ll explain why they might be tempting later), I firmly believe that they are unequivocally wrong and destructive to society as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the first one, “Secrets are Lies.” Bailey says that secrets “fester” within somone until they are shared and put out in the open, and that hiding a secret from someone is the same thing as lying to them. But, no matter how idealistic one may try to be, one must realize that secrets have a necessary place in society. I’m not talking about hiding from your spouse that you cheated on them. It’s things like your feelings about someone or something that you withold, not out of malice, but out of tact. Sometimes it’s best to keep your mouth shut, either because you know that what you’ll say will cause unnecessary strife, or because, like all humans, you know you’re fallible and may change your mind. It’s better to be cautious and keep your thoughts to yourself for some topics until you get more information or have more time to consider the consequences of sharing a secret. Sometimes people say things in confidentiality because they know what they tell you might not be “good,” but because they still need your advice and help. By forcing people to not have secrets about anything, we’d be living in a world without tact and without the ability to treat delicate matters with the cautiousness and confidentiality they deserve. Relationships would be ruined by minor things that would never become an issue otherwise. Sometimes one needs to keep something to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On to “Sharing is Caring.” This one is very similar to the above one. Things don’t need to be shared, especially if they’re linked to highly emotional topics, like an illness. Bailey says that these types of things need to be “demystified” and moved away from shame. But people don’t withhold from sharing things just because they’re ashamed. They don’t share them because they simply think that other people don’t need to know. In reality, most people do not need to know at all about certain illnesses or other personal matters. It’s not about “demystifing” those things, it’s just a matter of only letting those who actually deserve to know and care to know about personal matters. On the topic of Mae’s kayaking, and not wanting to share her experience (and later breaking the law and wanting to hide it), it’s silly to argue that not sharing all of one’s experiences is wrong. Nobody is entitled to your experiences. They’re yours. That’s what makes them special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have “Privacy is Theft.” Bailey makes the argument that without privacy, people would never do bad things, because they’d never even have a chocie to do anything due to not having any privacy. That idea is incredibly dangerous. Although it’s true that when people are aware that they’re being watched they’re less likely to commit crimes, it’s also true that when a society has a feeling of being watched or controlled, they moderate their actions to be conformist and subdued. We’d have no protests about injustices, no great thinkers standing up to speak new ideas, and no societal change. When people are forced to conform because they feel like they’re always being watched and judged, we lose our sense of individuality and thus lose a little bit of our humanity. We are not a herd to be controlled. Privacy is essential for the freedom of expression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These ideas may seem tantilizing, because, as Bailey argues, they could lead to less crime, a better ability to experience interesting and exciting things, and perhaps a more accepting and understanding society on certain issues, the negatives and conformity far outweigh the positives.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Essay &amp; Speech Revisions</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a few revisions I’m going to be making to my rhetorical artifact essay and speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my speech, I’m keeping the structure and format the same, but to aid in my presentation, I’ll be showing quotes overlaid over pictures to supplement my disucssion of the rhetorical devices used in the speech. I think that having quotes displayed will be better than me reading the quotes, and having topical photos beneath them will help draw attention and make them less boring. I also changed my introduction to be from a soldier’s perspective to make it more relatable and exciting to start off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my essay, I’ll do a few things. The general gist of the essay is that it’s comparing two speeches, given by Eisenhower and Stalin. Originally, my thesis was just about how the speeches were similar with a few differences. I’m gonna expand it to more prominently point out how typically one does not associate Eisenhower and Stalin to be similar people, but rhetorically, they were on the same page. That will add depth to the essay and make it more of a compelling read. I’ll also add in more evidence in the form of quotes, and analyze those pieces of evidence and how they contribute to the overall topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than those few things, I should be good!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Road</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/road.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;cover of The Road&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Road&lt;/em&gt;, by Cormac McCarthy, was another one of those English books that I was assigned senior year that I wasn’t too sure that I’d like. It was the last book of the year, assigned after the AP test, and I was kind of thinking to myself, “do I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; have to read this?” I had been looking forward to doing absolutely nothing in my classes after the AP tests. Athough my English teacher was one of my favorite teachers of all time, I really wasn’t liking his insistence on having a discussion on a book that I didn’t even know that I’d like during the last week of school. But I read it, because I actually like reading. It was more than worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Road&lt;/em&gt; is set in a post-apocalyptic America where basically nothing is recognizable. The entire landscape is grey and ashen. There is no life. The story revolves around a man and a boy, father and son. McCarthy’s writing is sparse, like the landscape, but one thing is incredibly vibrant: the strength of the father’s love for the boy. The father’s main focus is protecting and caring for his son. The story begins with a flashback that cuts to the core of the theme of the book that unfolds in the next pages. It’s an easy read, but the emotional impact of the story leaves a lasting effect on you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a long reading list, though, I would recommend waiting to read this book for a while. If you decide to have kids, wait until after that. My English teacher said that he read the book several times in his life–a few times before he was a father, and a few after. He said that the impact that the book had on him quadrupled after he became a father, because of the way the parent-child relationship is portrayed in the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or just read it now. It’s a good book regardless.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/eggers.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;cover&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my favorite book. If you’re looking for something to read, read this. You won’t regret it. It’s a visceral gut punch of a novel, a splash of cold water to the face that fills you with emotions—sadness, anger, joy—but often also with laughter. It’s unlike almost any other book I’ve read and it’s one of the few books that practically forced me to read it in one sitting (it’s over 400 pages—not an easy task). I don’t even know where to begin. The book overwhelmed me, tore me apart, and made me think differently about what literature can do. I don’t really know why it affected me so much. Maybe it was because of what was happening in my life when I read it. Or maybe it’s just that damn good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I should tell you what it’s about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Written by Dave Eggers (yes, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; Dave Eggers), &lt;em&gt;A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius&lt;/em&gt; starts out with an account of both Eggers’ parents’ declines and eventual deaths from cancer. Eggers must raise his younger brother, Toph, on his own while navigating through the daunting landscape of his young adult (early 20s) life. They travel across the country, and Eggers’ desire to explore his life and struggles with himself clash with his need to protect and raise Toph. You can feel the intensity of the emotions pouring through the pages—he writes furiously, sometimes speaking directly to the reader, sometimes blurring the line between reality and the imaginary to get his message across. It’s a wonder of postmodern writing, a stream-of-consciousness directly from Eggers brain, showing you his pain, his fears, and his desires. It’s a portrait of one human’s existence which is so different than most of ours, yet incredibly relatable. It will make your heart flare and your eyes tear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s so much packed into this book. Please just read it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Response to Zadie Smith</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Facebook is a superficial timewaster. I know this fact, and I think the majority of my generation also knows it. The irony of Smith’s critique of Facebook is that she assumes the primary victims are the generation “below” her, those of Zuckerberg’s age and younger, when in reality, Facebook is evermore becoming a tool for those of her own generation. I can’t remember the last time I made a list of interests, or posted a status update, or even scrolled through my newsfeed. I sometimes update my profile picture, but that’s just a matter of staying current. For me, Facebook is useful for messaging people (usually about school) when I don’t have their phone number. Or, I use it to join groups (again, mostly related school) to get updates about events or to ask questions. I may be in the minority, but my feeling is that Smith’s analyzation of Facebook and its users is a bit dated. The article was written in 2010, and while many of the things written were probably true then, six years later, Facebook is a bit different. It’s now my dad that posts statuses that gain dozens of likes, comments, and shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving past the shifting of the Facebook user landscape, I entirely agree with Smith’s characterization of those who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; still use Facebook, and, to an extent, other social media and her dissection of the birth and purpose of Facebook. I watched the Social Network, and, while I enjoyed it thoroughly, the real Mark Zuckerberg is not Aaron Sorkin’s Mark Zuckerberg. Smith hits the nail on the head with her description: “Controlled but dull, bright and clean but uniformly plain, nonideological, affectless.” That’s the sense you get when you visit a Facebook profile that actually has been fleshed out in the full “Zuckerberg” way. A neat list of interests. Selected favorite photos. Maybe even a short bio. It’s false; it doesn’t tell you if you’d like this person in real life. I crave authenticity in relationships. The “phony” online personas that people portray, whether it be selected pictures on Instagram or curated views on Facebook, don’t appeal to me. The best connections are made in person, intimately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, on to The Circle. It’s obvious that Eggers is setting up The Circle to be a hyperbolic expansion of Facebook, and Instagram, and Snapchat, and any other social media, a juggernaut expanded beyond control or boundary. Yet, it’s not too far from being accurate. Much like you can misinterpret what someone is like based on what they’ve “liked” on Facebook, Mae is shoehorned into a Portugal group simply based on years-old pictures. The way Mae obsessively increases her PartiRank reminded me of certain people I’ve seen mindlessly tapping through 30-40 Snapchats, sending the exact same bored face in response. It’s connection without substance, and it’s what Eggers and Smith warn against. Zuckerberg simply wants “connection,” but if the connections are weak, then they’re meaningless. I get the feeling that Eggers is in agreement with me about the best way to make connections—in personal, intimate settings. Mae is most drawn to those she meets in those situations—Kalden and Francis—and we are most drawn to Mae when she’s kayaking because we get to see her at one of her most private moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s this intimacy that The Circle and Facebook are really trying to create between people. We see this idea when Mae is chastised for not wanting to share &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; her experiences with other people, and in Facebook’s efforts to allow people to share more, and more. In The Circle’s case, it’s nefarious, while I tend to think (perhaps naively) that Facebook is more, just, optimistic. Regardless, it’s an impossible task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m afraid I may have been too harsh on social media. It’s a great tool for easily rekindling past connections, or to just have fun and waste time. Humans don’t have to be deep and introspective &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt;. We’re allowed to sometimes be superficial, to just send a funny face to a friend, or to share a picture because we think we look cute in it. It’s when this attitude consumes our life, like it rapidly is doing to Mae, that it becomes an issue. It’s when young, impressionable people start to believe the harsh comments on their posts, or when people begin to base their self-validation on how many likes their photo gets, that we need to reach out and let those people know there’s more to life than what’s on the screen. Social media can be fun and harmless, but we need to stay pragmatic about where its limits are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think Smith is too scathing of Facebook. It doesn’t have to be a zero sum game. We can have great, personal relationships that are also sustained and expanded through social media. While the overwhelming nature of The Circle looks scary, I doubt we’ll go that far, as long as we remember that people exist in real life too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’ve gotta go now, I have some Snapchats to respond to.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Last Lecture</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/lecture.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Last Lecture cover&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another week has gone by, and it’s time to review another one of my favorite books: &lt;em&gt;The Last Lecture&lt;/em&gt;, by Randy Pausch. &lt;em&gt;The Last Lecture&lt;/em&gt; is a book of lessons and stories written by Dr. Pausch, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon Universrity, after he was diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer. It originally started out as a lecture, titled “Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams.” There had been a movement going around in academia where top professors would deliver a “last lecture,” i.e. what they would say if it was their last chance to impart some message to the world. In Pausch’s case, it really was one of his final chances, as he was not expected to live longer than a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lecture went over incredibly well, and many of his friends and colleagues and students were there to listen and cheer him on. Pausch decided to write a book further expanding the topic so that his kids would have something from which to learn his beliefs, thoughts, and experiences when they grew up. The book is separated into three major topics. First, Pausch goes over all of his childhood dreams, like being a Disney Imagineer, being in zero gravity, or being Captain Kirk. Then, he goes into actually acheiveing those dreams (he actually achieves more of them than you would think!). He then goes on to discuss what he feels is an incredibly important thing—enabling the dreams of others. Finally, he discusses lessons he’s learned over his lifetime and has some direct messages to his kids for when they are old enough to read the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved this book. The messages it contains are simple, but meaningful. The whole concept of a man writing a book for his kids to read after his death really touched me and added so much emotional impact to every sentence I read. I’d like to close off with one of my favorite quotes from the book:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It’s not about how to achieve your dreams, it’s about how to lead your life, … If you lead your life the right way, the karma will take care of itself, the dreams will come to you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Civic Artifact Speech Outline</title>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Introduction
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Indroduce D-Day, talk about the odds that the Allied soldiers faced&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Talk about how important the invasion was, how everything hung in the balance&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Soldiers would have been nervous&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Need to somehow motivate them and excite them with one short speech&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Introduce Eisenhower and his speech&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;He needs to find the perfect words&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Thesis:
  - Eisenhower uses commonplace, pathos, and kairos to construct an energizing speech for his troops to march to victory&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1st point
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The speech uses commonplaces about freedom and democracy&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Contrasts the Germans and the Allies&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Not just American commonplaces, more universal&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;[will analyze quotes from speech here]&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Commonplaces remind soldiers what they’re fighting for&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Commonplaces that soldiers relate to effectively prepare them to fight with passion&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2nd point
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Eisenhower uses pathos for motivation&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Discusses “tyranny” of Nazis and their atrocities&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Supposed to evoke anger against germans and pity for victims&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Helps elevate drive to push forward and succeed&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Appeal to emotion is needed to ensure soldiers are passionate about their fight&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;3rd point
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Strongest motivating force in speech is kairos&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Uses recent allied victories to show that Germany is no longer dominating&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If the speech was earlier in the war, things would look much more bleak and would be harder to motivate&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If the US hadn’t started throwing their support from the mainland, also would’ve been more bleak&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Multiple factors combined together create the right moment for an invasion and right time for speech to motivate&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Conclusion
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Wartime creates opportune moments for great civic events&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Eisenhower’s speech effectively uses commonplaces that are heightened by the war to motivate troops&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pathos against German atrocities is another effective motivator&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Most importantly, the kairos of the situation gives Eisenhower’s speech credibility and strength&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Three rhetorical elements combine to drive Allied forces to victory on D-Day&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
